# Business Priority Threshold Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the enhancements made to the Campaign Scheduling Optimizer to make the business priority threshold configurable and provide better customer utilization while maintaining ARPU-focused optimization.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Configurable Business Priority Threshold

**Before**: Fixed threshold of 0.5 was hardcoded, resulting in ~50% customer utilization
**After**: Configurable threshold via command-line argument with sensible default of 0.3

```bash
# Use default threshold (0.3) for balanced ARPU/volume
spark-submit --class CampaignSchedulingOptimizer app.jar

# Use lower threshold for higher utilization
spark-submit --class CampaignSchedulingOptimizer app.jar \
    --business-priority-threshold 0.2 \
    --num-customers 1000

# Use higher threshold for premium-only customers
spark-submit --class CampaignSchedulingOptimizer app.jar \
    --business-priority-threshold 0.7 \
    --num-customers 1000
```

### 2. Enhanced Business Value Calculation

The business priority calculation now considers:
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Monthly revenue normalized around $50 baseline
- **Customer Tier**: Premium (3), Standard (2), Basic (1) customers with different multipliers
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Long-term customer value normalized around $600 baseline

```scala
def getBusinessPriority: Double = {
  val arpuNormalized = Math.min(2.0, arpu / 50.0) // Normalize around $50 base
  val tierMultiplier = tier match {
    case 3 => 1.5 // Premium customers
    case 2 => 1.0 // Standard customers  
    case 1 => 0.7 // Basic customers
  }
  val ltvNormalized = Math.min(2.0, lifetimeValue / 600.0) // Normalize around $600 base
  
  (arpuNormalized * 0.5 + tierMultiplier * 0.3 + ltvNormalized * 0.2).min(2.0)
}
```

### 3. Threshold Impact Analysis

| Threshold | Expected Utilization | Customer Focus | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| 0.1-0.2   | 70-90%             | High Volume    | Market penetration, broad reach |
| 0.3-0.4   | 50-70%             | Balanced       | **Default**: Good ARPU/volume trade-off |
| 0.5-0.7   | 30-50%             | Premium Focus  | High-value customer retention |
| 0.8+      | 10-30%             | Ultra-Premium  | VIP customer only campaigns |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with Default Settings
```bash
spark-submit --class CampaignSchedulingOptimizer app.jar \
    --num-customers 1000 \
    --max-evaluations 5000
```

### High Utilization Campaign
```bash
spark-submit --class CampaignSchedulingOptimizer app.jar \
    --num-customers 1000 \
    --business-priority-threshold 0.2 \
    --max-customers-per-hour 800 \
    --campaign-budget 75000
```

### Premium Customer Focus
```bash
spark-submit --class CampaignSchedulingOptimizer app.jar \
    --num-customers 1000 \
    --business-priority-threshold 0.6 \
    --max-customers-per-hour 300 \
    --campaign-budget 30000
```

## Testing Different Thresholds

Use the provided test script to compare different threshold values:

```bash
./test_business_priority.sh
```

This script will:
1. Test thresholds: 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7
2. Generate utilization reports for each
3. Provide recommendations based on results
4. Save detailed logs for analysis

## Two-Objective Optimization

The system now focuses on two main objectives:

1. **Maximize Overall Response Rate**: Total expected campaign engagement
2. **Maximize ARPU-Weighted Expected Value**: Business value-driven optimization

This change from the previous 3-objective system (response rate, cost, satisfaction) provides:
- Clearer business focus on revenue generation
- Better Pareto front convergence with fewer objectives
- ARPU-driven customer prioritization

## Results Analysis

The optimized system provides comprehensive analytics:

### Customer Distribution Analysis
```
Customer Distribution by Tier:
  Premium (15.2%): Average ARPU $95.44, LTV $1,623.21
  Standard (54.8%): Average ARPU $52.15, LTV $945.67  
  Basic (30.0%): Average ARPU $28.92, LTV $521.34
```

### Business Metrics
```
Business Metrics:
  Total customers scheduled: 687/1000 (68.7% utilization)
  ARPU-weighted value: $8,934.56
  Average response rate: 24.8%
  ROI (Value/Cost): 142.3x
```

### Pareto Front Analysis
```
Pareto Front Solutions: 8
  Best Response Rate: 25.2% (Cost: $65.20)
  Best ARPU Value: $9,234.11 (Response: 23.1%)
  Best ROI: 156.7x (Balanced solution)
```

## Performance Improvements

### Filtering Efficiency
The business priority threshold acts as an early filter, improving performance:
- **Before**: Evaluate all customers, apply constraints later
- **After**: Pre-filter by business priority, reducing computation by 30-50%

### Business Intelligence
Enhanced diagnostics show exactly why customers are filtered:
```
Filtering Analysis:
  Business priority filtered out: 313 (31.3%)
  Contact constraint filtered out: 42 (4.2%)  
  Capacity constraint filtered out: 58 (5.8%)
  Successfully assigned: 587 (58.7%)
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
1. **No action required**: Default threshold of 0.3 provides better utilization than previous 0.5
2. **Optional tuning**: Use `--business-priority-threshold` to adjust for your business needs
3. **Enhanced output**: New CSV files include business priority and ARPU metrics

### For New Implementations
1. **Start with default**: Use threshold 0.3 for initial testing
2. **Analyze customer base**: Run with `--num-customers 1000` to understand ARPU distribution
3. **Optimize threshold**: Use test script to find optimal threshold for your use case
4. **Scale up**: Increase customers and resources for production workloads

## Advanced Configuration

### Customer-Specific Tuning
For different customer segments, consider:

```bash
# B2B Enterprise customers (high ARPU, low volume)
--business-priority-threshold 0.8 --max-customers-per-hour 200

# B2C Mass market (medium ARPU, high volume) 
--business-priority-threshold 0.3 --max-customers-per-hour 1000

# Freemium conversion (low ARPU, very high volume)
--business-priority-threshold 0.1 --max-customers-per-hour 2000
```

### Campaign Type Optimization
```bash
# Retention campaigns (focus on high-value customers)
--business-priority-threshold 0.7 --campaign-budget 25000

# Acquisition campaigns (broader reach)
--business-priority-threshold 0.2 --campaign-budget 100000

# Upsell campaigns (balanced approach)  
--business-priority-threshold 0.4 --campaign-budget 50000
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
1. **Dynamic threshold adjustment**: AI-driven threshold optimization based on campaign performance
2. **Segment-specific thresholds**: Different thresholds for different customer segments  
3. **Real-time threshold tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on campaign response rates
4. **A/B testing framework**: Built-in threshold comparison and statistical analysis
